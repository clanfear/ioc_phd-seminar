# The Growth of Airbnb

.footnote[Source: [Sherwood (2019) *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/05/airbnb-homelessness-renting-housing-accommodation-social-policy-cities-travel-leisure)]

???

Everyone knows about Airbnb; how many people here have stayed at an Airbnb? Rented one out?

Airbnb and the rest of the short-term rental market has reached a scale where it is having impacts on cities.

---
# Housing Markets

Barron et al. (2020, p. 45):

&gt; To summarize the state of the literature on home-sharing, research (including this paper) has found that **home-sharing (1) raises local rental rates** by causing a reallocation of the housing stock, (2) **raises house prices** through both the capitalization of rents and the increased ability to use excess capacity...

???

The most well-recognized effects are on housing markets as properties are reallocated away from long-term uses, driving prices up for both renters and buyers.

# Criminological Theory

## and Airbnb


---
# Routine Activity Theory

![](./img/routine_activity.svg)


* A crime is the result of a criminal .bam[opportunity]

* Anything that creates opportunities will increase crime rates

  * This occurs *rapidly*

---
# Airbnb and Routine Activity

* Guests as *likely offenders*

   * More prone to anti-social behaviour

--

* Guests as *suitable targets*

   * Often away from residence (e.g., assault, robbery)
   * Less aware of and averse to risky situations
   * Recognizable as high-value targets
--

* Guests as *incapable guardians*

   * Less attached to neighborhood
   * Unfamiliar with residents and local norms
   * Often away from residence (e.g., burglary)

--

.centernote[These are stronger for *entire properties* than *spare rooms*.]

---
# Social Disorganization



![](./img/social_disorganization.svg)


* Strong neighborhood institutions reduce crime by promoting .bam[social control]

* Destabilizing social structures increases crime by reducing social control

   * This usually occurs *slowly*

---
## Airbnb and Social Disorganization

Entire properties replace longer-term residents with *very* short-term ones

* Reduces attachment to neighbourhood
* Inhibits network formation
* Weakens institutions

--

Spare rooms *add* short-term residents:

* Less disruptive
* May promote stability with additional income

---
# Broken Windows

.image-75[
![](./img/broken_windows.svg)
]

* Disorder signals criminal opportunity

* Social control impedes crime and disorder

* Fear of crime causes withdrawal and destabilization, reducing social control


???

Reciprocal relationships between social control and disorder and crime

Some forms of social disorder may escalate into crime; drinking can turn into fighting

Disorder may drive residents out of neighborhood

---
# Airbnb and Broken Windows

Airbnb income may enable property rehabilitation

* Remediation of seriously disorderly properties reduces crime

--

Airbnb activity increases property values

* Increases tax base, incentives for social control, and police attention

--

Airbnb activity may generate disorder

* Escalates into more serious crime (opportunity)
* Reduces attachment to neighborhood and induces move-outs (destabilization)

--

.centernote[*Will mainly focus on routine activity and social disorganization today*]

# Causal Model

We encode these theories into a causal model

# Hypotheses

1. Airbnb properties are positively related to crime

2. Entire properties will be more strongly related to crime than rooms

3. Airbnb activity will be negatively related to collective efficacy

4. The association between Airbnb activity and crime is partly mediated by collective efficacy

# The Setting

# Airbnb and London

* One of the most popular Airbnb markets

  * \&gt; 100,000 listings in a year&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
  * 20% of surveyed households hosted in past year&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
  * \&gt;= 10% of dwellings are Airbnbs in some districts&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[

--

* Recent policies promote Airbnb usage

  * Deregulation Act 2015

      * Permits 90 days of main residence renting per year

  * 2016 "Rent a Room" tax allowance

      * Increased from £4,250 to £7,500

Our project focuses on London, one of the most popular Airbnb markets in the world.

Airbnb activity mainly predicts instrumental crimes

* More consistent with routine activity than social disorganization

Mainly contemporaneous effects

* Consistent with routine activity
* Inconsistent with social disorganization

--

Association is limited to entire homes and apartments

* Consistent with both theories

# Measuring Collective Efficacy

Collective efficacy is a community-level .bam[latent variable]

* Survey respondents act as *informants*

--

Assume informant responses to collective efficacy indicators are a mix of:

* Latent variable we want to measure
* Non-systematic (random) measurement error
* Systematic perceptual error of individuals

--

Validity of measurement rests on .bam[reliability], a function of:

* Agreement between informants
* **Number of informants in each neighborhood**

--

# Discussion

---
# Key Results

* Airbnb activity strongly associated with robbery, burglary, and theft
   
   * Some association with violence

--

* Effects appear operate in short-term

   * Suggests opportunity as mechanism

--

* Effects driven by entire homes and apartments for rent

--

* Little evidence for mediation by collective efficacy

  * Weak negative relationship with Airbnb
  * Airbnb effects not attenuated when including collective efficacy

---
# Limitations

* Omitted time-varying confounders

  * Results insensitive to English Premier League games

--

* Effect heterogeneity

  * Results insensitive to spatial clustering interaction

--

* Causal timing may be off

  * Results similar from TWFE Poisson

--

* Collective efficacy less time stable than expected

   * Low indicator variation
   * May not be tapping social control capacity well

--

* Police-reported crime

   * Local authorities share ASB responsibilities

---
# Implications

Private short-term letting is reshaping the urban landscape

* Constraining rental markets
* Increasing home prices
* .bam[Compromising public safety]

--

Short-term letting is highly commercialized

* Dominated by dedicated properties
* Hosts with multiple properties

--

An externality problem

* Benefits accrue to few property owners
* Livability and affordability reduced for all

--

.centernote[*Policymakers should revisit short-term letting market incentives and regulation*]
